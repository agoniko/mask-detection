# mask detection
This is my second project of computer vision, here I try to detect if the person in front of the camera has a mask on or not.

It can eventualy work for multiple faces but testing it i noticed that when another person is around the model doesn't predict well if you have your musk up or not.

## Note
This code is my version of the tutorial found on data-flair.training
